# Solution Nyan

This is the source code for Solution Nyan, my personal website for sharing progress on projects that I work on.
Due to the way that Neocities works, this website is designed to work mostly statically. That means fast load times, but
there is minimal
dynamic content. All "dynamic" content is hosted in this repository, and is just images and articles.

Everything is written using JavaScript, HTML and SCSS with some smatterings of CSS.
