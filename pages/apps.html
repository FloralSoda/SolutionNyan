		<h1>Apps & Utilities</h1>
		<p>
			I've always enjoyed building utilities. My very first script was a.. not-so-secure password lock for a door
			in a video game. The person I showed it to immediately broke it by opening up the script but that started my
			career as a software dev! Since then, I've been honing my skills, building little tools for me and my friends,
			little libraries and utilities to aid making these tools, and soon I shall be releasing full applications to
			the public in the hopes that my code has improved enough for public use. I have already provided code for
			industry, but my true goal is to become a public staple on devices everywhere.
