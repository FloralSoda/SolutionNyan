		<legend>About this Website</legend>
		<p>
			This website is partially a portfolio website, where someone can look through the stuff I've worked on
			and see the skills I have. However, it's also for hosting tech I've made - Not just a portal to code
			repositories, but access to JS/WASM tools I've written that might be useful.
		</p>
		<p>
			In its current state, where everything is hosted on Github, this website just serves as a portal to the
			different code repositories I own and as a static host to various articles I write about random things
			that interest me.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the future, I plan to host this website on my own server, whether through a VPS or my own hardware.
			At such a time, this website will become the host for my code itself, likely based on <a href="https://forgejo.org/">Forgejo</a>,
			to keep my code safe from being scraped without my consent. It would also have the benefit of effectively
			limitless storage and free rein over the processing capabilities of my server.

				<p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
					I go by a lot of names. Lexi, Lily, Hydro, Jelly, FloralSoda, etc. All of them are me! I'm a UK-born girly
					with a love for computers, games and maths!~ Naturally, I speak English, but I am also learning
					Dansk and 日本語! Hej! こんにちわ!
				</p>
				<p>
					I don't have university education, but I have equivalent experience in the software industry, on top of
					years of hobby work that taught me most of what I know. I specialise in building tools and simulations,
					but I've been formally trained in web tech. The use of the GPU is my current fixation, and I
					hope that it becomes a powerful tool in my pocket for future projects as I develop my understanding
					of WGSL and Vulkan.
				</p>
				<p>
					In terms of software, I can write in most languages. Like any other programmer worth their salt,
					I can pick up a language fairly competently in a few months, and I do enjoy this process! I love
					finding languages that fit a niche, and then learning that language as and when I need that niche.
					Typically, it's for performance reasons, as ease of writing is something I add into the language
					myself if its features allow me to and its ease of use isn't already to my liking.
				</p>
				<p>
					That being said, I do have my opinions on these languages:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>JavaScript is flexible and great for prototyping, but it falls apart as you start building
						larger projects with it due to it trying to be more than it is.</li>
					<li>C is perfect as a small (in size, not in scope) language that can be used for anything,
						though I don't like how much weight there is on the developer getting everything perfect, both
						in its community and in its feature set.</li>
					<li>Conversely, Rust is perfect for large scale projects as its compiler enforces practices that
						prevent a lot of common mistakes. The downside, to me, is the compilation time. Awful for
						iterative development. I hear there's lots of work being done on that front though, so I look
						forward to that!</li>
					<li>I haven't done loads of Python, but it's like JavaScript to me but with a harder to understand
						syntax. The use of indentation instead of braces is too weird for me, and makes it somewhat vague
						where the scopes end until you see the next line of code.</li>
				</ul>
